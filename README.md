## Description

ABOUT REPOSITORY

This is how YouTube videos can be embedded in an Iframe on the HTML code

When the site (https://stewilondanga.github.io/television/) is loaded the site gives you quite some information as listed below

It tells you the project title

It shows an embedded iframe which has video numbers from the playlist which you can choose from. The iframe lists the YouTube video id of the video playing and gives you the button options of play, pause and stop.

There are two bars, one for showing the duration the video has played and the other for adjusting the volume

The URL of the video playing is displayed

The output quality of the video playing is stated as well as the available quality outputs.

The state in which the video is at the moment is also shown, which could either be playing, paused or stopped

How much the video has loaded from YouTube is stated in percentage form. One hundred percent means the whole video has loaded into the playlist

The length duration of the video from start to stop is stated in minutes and seconds and equated to what percentage of the total minutes the whole playlist is taking

The output sound volume is displayed in percentage

There is a space provided for listing the current errors you must be facing. This is done by the YouTube API as it tries to access its resources which are videos from YouTube

There is a sample code for embedding the video that would be currently playing just incase the specific video is needed by other developers

Finally there are listed references related to the development of the webpage and this repository
